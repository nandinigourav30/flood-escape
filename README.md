🌊 Flood Escape — Platformer Game (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

Flood Escape is a fast-paced mini-platformer game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is simple: climb the platforms and escape the rising water before you drown!

This project demonstrates logic building, game mechanics, rendering, collision detection, and dynamic animations using pure JavaScript — no frameworks.
